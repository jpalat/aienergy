Goldydocs provides a single web UI providing visibility into porridge
temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics! You can even find out who's
been eating **your** porridge.

(Sadly, Goldydocs isn't a real project, but you can use this site as an example
to create your own real websites with [Docsy](https://docsy.dev))

Environmental Impacts of AI Systems
Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant environmental costs throughout its lifecycle, including:

Energy Consumption: AI systems require substantial energy for training and inference
* Water Usage: Data centers need cooling systems that consume large amounts of water
* Hardware Resources: Manufacturing GPUs and other components requires rare minerals
* Carbon Footprint: Both operational and embodied emissions contribute to climate impact
